{"id":"chunk-4","content":"During  heavier  load  the  speed  and  voltage  (and  hence  thermal  output)  are  increased.   The\ninternal governor will throttle back both the CPU speed and voltage to make sure the CPU temperature\nnever exceeds 85 degrees C.\nThe Pi4B will operate perfectly well without any extra cooling and is designed for sprint performance -\nexpecting a light use case on average and ramping up the CPU speed when needed (e.g.  when loading\na webpage).  If a user wishes to load the system continually or operate it at a high temperature at full\nperformance, further cooling may be needed.\n6    Availability\nRaspberry Pi guarantees availability of the Pi4B until at least January 2031.\n11Release 1.1\n\nRaspberry Pi 4 Model B Datasheet\nCopyright Raspberry Pi (Trading) Ltd. 2024\n7    Support\nFor support please see the hardware documentation section of the Raspberry Pi website and post ques-\ntions to the Raspberry Pi forum.\n12Release 1."}
